# MIA : A Celeste Bot

## Functionnement

#### View

**Entities**

Celeste function with an Entity system. All of the things on the screen you can interact with are entities.

**Solid Tiles**

Solid tiles is one of the major entities. It represent all the tiles on the screen. Tiles are non-moving blocks or plateforms, that you just step on.

All solid tiles are given with a char map, named the tilemap. '0' represent nothing, otherwise there is something.

Here is Celestial Resort representation with the tilemap :

**Other entities**

Other entities are things like the Jumpthrough platforms, falling blocks,




























In the context of a school project, I've created an AI wich aim to play Celeste and evolve, using NEAT algorith.

The project is still in developpement.

For now, through a mod, I can access to informations I need (Entities, tiles and player data). Thoses will be implemented in a neural network later.
